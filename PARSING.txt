Parsing Guide for this project
In the db/ folder, there's a file fresh-preSchedules.yml.  This file has the database before the schedule parser is ever run.  To restore the database with this file, do rake db:reset then cp db/fresh-preSchedules.yml db/data.yml.  Then run rake db:data:load.  After the database is restored, edit the lib/tasks/schedules.rake file to set USERNAME and PASSWORD to the correct values.  Run rake schedules:parseSchedules; you will be prompted to login to the schedule search when the firefox window comes up. Now don't touch anything and wait for it to finish.  The database is now populated, but we have to fix errors.  Run rake schedules:purgeBlankSchedules and rake schedules:convertToCommitments to clean up the database.  Execute the dumpDB.sh script. You'll now have a file data.tar.gz in the folder.  Add it to the git repo and push it up to heroku.  Do heroku run bash to get a terminal on their server.  On their server, run ./restoreDB.sh.  It should now work.
This is kinda tricky because since schedules are down I have absolutely no way of testing this.  Hopefully it'll work.
