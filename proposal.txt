    We aim to extend the functionality of PANet's Schedule Search program.
     
Market Analysis

    Customer:
        Students and faculty here at PA

    Product/Purpose:
	Replicate functionality of current schedule search app while providing a more attractive and user-friendly interface
	Enable the user to search for class rosters
	Allow easy exporting of schedules as an image  
	Provide social networking integration
	Ideas for 2.0: Obtain administrative support or access to actual schedule database. (1.0 would be standalone and would depend upon a script to download all student schedules and store them in a server-side database)

    Competition
	The current schedule access program lacks extended functionality and is cumbersome. Various glitches have been occasionally observed on a variety of platforms and browsers.  
	With the current program, it is impractical to see what students are in a given class. PANet allows users to view the rosters of classes they are in, however these rosters often become available only after classes have begun. Our program would enable the user to view the rosters of any class at any time.
	If a user wishes to export their schedule for use as a wallpaper or to share on Facebook, the current schedule system requires the user to take a screenshot of their schedule, which is clunky and can be difficult on small screens.

    Price:
	Free

    Promotion:
        Promotion is not a major concern due to the small target audience.
